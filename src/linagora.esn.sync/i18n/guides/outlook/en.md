## Email synchronization

To check your emails, you can either use the OpenPaaS web interface or an email client. Here, you will learn how to associate your email account to **Outlook 2016**, an email client. This synchronization will allow you to read already received emails, even when you are offline.

*The following instructions might work with version older than Outlook 2016, but bear in mind that we only support Outlook 2016 and onwards.*

### Set up a new email account

1. First, you need to launch Outlook 2016, by double-clicking on its shortcut, as shown bellow.

## Calendars synchronization

To view your calendar, you can either use the OpenPaaS web interface or any native calendar application compatible with the CalDAV protocol. Unfortunately Outlook is not compatible with CalDAV. In order to use Outlook to view and edit your calendar, the `Outlook CalDav Synchronizer` add-on will have to be installed. Once it is done, you will be able to associate your OpenPaaS-based calendar with Outlook.

*To install the synchronizer add-on, administrator rights are required. If you don't know whether you have them or not, please ask your local IT support team*

### Prerequisite: Outlook CalDav Synchronizer

1. First, open any web browser such as Firefox, Chrome, or Internet Explorer.
