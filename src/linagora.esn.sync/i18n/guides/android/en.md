## Email synchronization

To check your emails, you can use the OpenPaaS web interface or an email application. Here, you will learn how to associate your email account to an email application using the IMAP protocol. This synchronization will allow you to read already received emails, even when you are offline.

### Set up a new email account

> Caution: the following steps may vary from one manufacturer to the other.

1. Swipe down from the top of your screen to reveal the panel and go to **Settings** by tapping the gear-shaped icon.

## Contacts & Calendars synchronization

### Prerequisites

By default, Android devices do not natively support the CalDAV and CardDAV protocols. As a result, they cannot display remote calendars locally. In order for you to access your events or contacts on your phone without a web browser, you will need to install `DAVdroid`, an application which will manage this synchronization.

> Caution: in order to work, `DAVdroid` requires at least `Android 4.4`. If your smartphone is less than five years old, you should be ready to go.

1. By default, Android will only allow the installation of applications coming from the Google market. To install DAVdroid, you will need to let your phone install applications coming from "Unknown Sources". To do so, navigate to the menu `Settings > Security` and activate the corresponding option.

    ![enable unknown sources](/account/images/en/android_davdroid_unknown_src.png)

2. You can then Download the [DAVdroid apk](/account/downloads/davdroid/at.bitfire.davdroid_245.apk) file.
3. Open the `Downloads` app, or if missing the `File explorer` app.
4. Within the *Downloads* folder, scroll down to the bottom if necessary.
5. Find and tap the most recent downloaded item.
6. Tap `Install`.

    ![install DAVdroid](/account/images/en/android_davdroid_installed.png)

7. Tap `Open`.
8. Go to the welcome screen by skipping licence warnings.
9. Once you have installed DAVdroid, return to the `Settings > Security` menu, and then **disable** the option to allow the installation of applications coming from `Unknown Sources`.

    ![enable unknown sources](/account/images/en/android_davdroid_unknown_src.png)

### Configure calendars and address books synchronization

1. Once DAVdroid is open, tap the `+` button.

    ![empty DAVdroid](/account/images/en/android_davdroid_empty.png)

2. Set your email address `<%= user.preferredEmail %>` and domain password.

    ![DAV domain credentials](/account/images/en/android_davdroid_add_account.png)

3. Tap `Login`.
4. Tap `Create Account` then tap *added yellow item*.

    ![DAV yellow button](/account/images/en/android_davdroid_accounts_list.png)

5. At this point, DAVdroid may require further permissions, most notably to access your calendar and contacts. Grant those permissions to DAVdroid.
6. To enable synchronization, make sure to tick boxes located next to the CardDAV and CalDAV cards.

7. You may tap on the *gear icon* to adjust synchronization settings.
